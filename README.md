Project EchoNote is a multi-stage pipeline designed to analyse multi-speaker meetings. It begins with automatic transcription and speaker diarisation to segment and label each speaker's contributions. The transcribed and segmented text is then processed through a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate structured analyses and summaries, including insights into individual perspectives. Finally, the output is converted into a natural-sounding podcast using text-to-speech (TTS) technology, creating an accessible audio summary of the meeting.# Echonote_demo
